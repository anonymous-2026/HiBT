"""Resume I/O helpers for planner training scripts.

This module is the single place that knows how to preserve the
observability artefacts of a previous training run when a new run
resumes from a checkpoint. Three concerns are covered:

1. SwanLab run continuity via ``logs/<exp>/swanlab.json``.
   A fresh run writes the file once with the newly-allocated run id;
   every subsequent resume records a ``resume_events`` entry and bumps
   ``resume_count``. The file is the on-disk source of truth consulted
   when the operator does NOT pass ``--swanlab-id`` explicitly.

2. Rotation of log files that CANNOT be safely appended.
   ``training.log`` (python logging FileHandler) and
   ``terminal_output.jsonl`` (line-oriented JSON) are renamed to
   ``<stem>.part<N>.<ext>`` on every resume, with N monotonically
   increasing across resumes. The CURRENT run always writes to the
   un-suffixed name, so ``tail -f training.log`` during an active run
   works without knowing about parts.

3. Reload of history JSON files that CAN be extended.
   ``training_history.json``, ``eval_history.json``, and
   ``eval_sample_history.json`` are plain lists of rows; on resume we
   load them back into memory so the new run appends to the existing
   history rather than clobbering it when the first epoch-end rewrite
   fires.

The module is intentionally free of any swanlab or top-level torch
imports so it can be unit-tested and imported by the launcher without
pulling heavy dependencies. The schema-validation peek inside
``find_latest_checkpoint`` lazy-imports torch ONLY when an actual
resume is performed (never during launcher import).

    "Most recent" = the file whose ``epoch<N>-step<M>`` tag has the
    highest ``(step, epoch)`` tuple. ``global_step`` is the monotonic
    authority during training; ``epoch`` only breaks ties when two
    files share the same step (rare, e.g. an epoch-end checkpoint
    taken at the same step as a periodic one).

    Matches any filename shaped like
    ``checkpoint*-epoch<N>-step<M>.pt`` so best / best_eval / periodic
    / epoch-end variants are ALL considered. This is deliberate: on
    resume we want to continue from the latest STATE, whatever tag it
    happens to carry — a crash right after a best_eval save is a
    perfectly valid anchor for the next run.

    Schema-validated walk: candidates are visited newest → oldest and
    each one is peeked via ``_is_schema_valid_checkpoint``. Files that
    cannot be loaded as a dict, or that are missing required keys
    (``model_state_dict`` / ``optimizer_state_dict`` /
    ``scheduler_state_dict`` / ``epoch`` / ``step``), are skipped
    with a stderr WARN and the next-best candidate is tried. This
    keeps resume robust to historical schema drift — e.g. legacy
    ``checkpoint_best_eval-*.pt`` written by ``commit 1a510ef`` had a
    different (eval-only) shape and would otherwise crash the loader.

    Raises ``CheckpointNotFoundError`` if the directory is missing,
    contains zero matching files, OR every matching file fails the
    schema check. Fail-loud is strictly better than a silent
    fresh-start that clobbers the operator's expectation of
